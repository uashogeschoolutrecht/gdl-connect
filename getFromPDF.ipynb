    "API stands for Application Programming Interface and is a way to communicate to websites, databases and software from a terminal or via a programming language script. Many application on the internet use it to be able to communicate with the application in a more efficient and faster way. For a good start on what an API is and how it works, see [this wiki](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).\n",

    "To use an API, it is essenstial that you master some programming skills. Many APIs have implementations in R and Python, and for this reason alone it will pay of to learn about programming. "

    "As you may have seen yourself, one way of interacting with generative AI models is through a so-called 'prompt'. This is basically a query or a request entered in a chat-like fashion.

    "## API\n",
    "An API or Application Programming Interface is a piece of software that allows controlled access to computational resources. It has a lookup principle to check if a procedure is allowed or not. Kinda like a waiter presenting you a menu to choose from; you are allowed to choose something from the menu, but not something that is not on the menu, and the cook will cook only that what you oredered. Usually APIs are there to efficiently 'talk' to the computationals resources. Using an API via a programming language (in this case through Python) allows for multiplication of tasks and interactions with the LLM that would be very tidious and error-prone to perform in the OpenAI GUI. In this case, we need to have a specific password (key) that allows access to the LLM. The API we are using here is thus also a gateway. Sort-of a waiter and a bouncer in one person. The key is stored here in a secret file, which prevents me writing the key in the code. Python (the `dotenv` library) takes care of getting the key for me.  "
