Adverse outcome pathways in modern toxicology,What are AOPs?
AOPs and NAMs,
Current approaches building AOPs,
Advances in Natural Language Processing,
AOP developer inspection,ensure models are providing correct information
Information gathering,store information in machine-readable format
Graph databases,enable easy visualization of relationships and their WoE
NAMs support,can be used as input for similarity approaches in chemical screening
WoE for KERs,help in the discovery of novel events and combining AOPs into networks
Limitations of the approach,availability of open-science format publications and bias for positive results
Animal testing-based toxicology,gain from the introduction of new machine learning techniques
NLP,describe AOPs and support the selection of KEs for testing in NAMs
Machine learning techniques,improve the knowledge gathering process from literature
